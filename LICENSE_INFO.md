# License Information for IceBoat Mod

This document explains the different license options available for your IceBoat Minecraft mod.

## Current License

The mod is currently licensed under **MIT** according to the `fabric.mod.json` file, but has a **CC0 1.0 Universal** license file. You should choose one consistent license for your project.

## License Options

### MIT License (LICENSE.MIT)
- **Permissive** license that allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute your code
- Requires attribution (your copyright notice must be included)
- Does not require derivative works to be open-source
- Good for maximum adoption and use in both open and closed-source projects
- Simple and widely understood

### CC0 1.0 Universal (LICENSE)
- **Public domain dedication** - effectively waives all copyright
- No attribution required
- Anyone can use your work for any purpose without restrictions
- Simplest option for allowing unrestricted use
- Not specifically designed for software (more common for creative works)

### GNU General Public License v3 (LICENSE.GPL-3.0)
- **Copyleft** license that requires derivative works to also be open-source
- Any modifications must be released under the same license
- Source code must be made available when distributing the software
- Ensures your mod remains free and open
- More restrictive but protects against proprietary forks

### Apache License 2.0 (LICENSE.Apache-2.0)
- **Permissive** license similar to MIT
- Includes patent protection provisions
- Requires attribution
- Allows use in proprietary software
- More detailed than MIT with explicit patent grants

## How to Choose

1. **For maximum freedom and adoption**: Use MIT or Apache 2.0
2. **To ensure derivatives remain open-source**: Use GPL-3.0
3. **To dedicate to the public domain**: Use CC0 1.0

## Updating Your License

To update your license choice:

1. Rename your preferred license file to `LICENSE` (or keep the existing one if choosing CC0)
2. Update the "license" field in `fabric.mod.json` to match your choice
3. Include a license notice in your source code files
